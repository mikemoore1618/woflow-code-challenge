## Tech

Explanations of the technologies used:

- HTML- Hype Text Markup Language is used to structure text and multimedia documents and to set up hypertext links between documents. Used in web developmemnt to create the basic structure of a web site. 
- CSS- Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used to edit the style and appearance of a web site.
